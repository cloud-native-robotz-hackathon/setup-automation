# Robot Hackathon - Automated Setup

Ansible automation to install and configure the OpenShift components for the hackathon.

Currently supported OpenShift version 4.12

Currently installed components:

- Gitea (including repos)
- ODF
- Quay
- DevSpaces
- Web Terminal

## Run Options

The current version only supports running the playbooks in an Ansible Executing Environment a.k.a a container.

You can run the environment either on your local machine with access to a bastion host or on the bastion host directly(for example a RHPDS bastion host)

## Install ansible-navigator

The automation needs to be run with the `ansible-navigator` command.

### Installation Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8

You will need a valid Red Hat Subscription, then you can subscribe your RHEL host by

```
subscription-manager register

# get pool id via:
# subscription-manager list --available
subscription-manager attach [--auto] --pool=...

subscription-manager repos --disable=*

subscription-manager repos \
    --enable=rhel-8-for-x86_64-baseos-rpms \
    --enable=rhel-8-for-x86_64-appstream-rpms \
    --enable=rhel-8-for-x86_64-highavailability-rpms \
    --enable=ansible-automation-platform-2.1-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms


yum install -y ansible-navigator git podman

```

Note: If using a bastion on RHPDS or RHDP environments you need to unregister from the lab Satellite server and switch to the Red Hat cdn base url:

```
[root@bastion ~]$ subscription-manager unregister
[root@bastion ~]$ cp /etc/rhsm/rhsm.conf.kat-backup /etc/rhsm/rhsm.conf
```

This is the easiest way, if there is no rhsm.conf backup put this in your rhsm.conf:

```
[rhsm]
# Content base URL:
baseurl = https://cdn.redhat.com
```

Then proceed as above.

### Installation Centos Stream 8

Ansible navigator installation based on the upstream [documentation](https://ansible-navigator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/#install-ansible-navigator).

```bash
dnf install -y python3-pip podman git
python3 -m pip install ansible-navigator --user
echo 'export PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.profile
source ~/.profile

```

## Clone and prepare the project

You are now ready to clone this project to your system (local or bastion).

```
git clone https://github.com/cloud-native-robotz-hackathon/setup-automation.git
cd setup-automation
```

## Copy the inventory template and customize it

If running Ansible from a laptop or else:

```
cp inventory/custom_hosts.ini.template inventory/custom_hosts.ini
```

and replace <SSH JUMPHOST HOSTNAME> with the bastion hostname and <SSH_USER> and <SSH_PASSWORD>

If running Ansible on the bastion host, the inventory should look like:

```
<internal bastion IP> ansible_user=lab-user ansible_password=<SSH password>
```

## Check and adjust the path to kubeconfig on your bastion

The path is defined in `vars.yml` as _remote_kubeconfig_path_.

The default matches the position in a RHPDS bastion, so adjust if required.

## Run the automation

```
ansible-navigator run -m stdout ansible/setup.yml -i inventory/custom_hosts.ini
```

### Customize the automation

#### Installed components

By default the script will install all components.

You can choose to skip certain components by applying tags

The following tags are available

- prepare (must always be executed)
- gitea
- gitea_repo
- odf
- quay
- devspaces
- pipelines
- webterminal
- ods

For example to just install RHODS, execute

```
ansible-navigator run -m stdout ansible/setup.yml -i inventory/custom_hosts.ini --tags=prepare,ods
```

#### Other configurations

You can further adjust the installation via environment variables

The following environment variables are available to be overwritten

- gitea_ssl: true

For example to install Gitea without SSL you can use to following command

```
ansible-navigator run -m stdout ansible/setup.yml -i inventory/custom_hosts.ini -e '{"gitea_ssl":false}'
```

# Optional : Build you own Execution Environment

In case you need to adjust the environment by adding additional tools you can build you own EE image

## Build Ansible execution with Podman

This will build a local version of the EE image

```bash
ansible-builder build \
    --container-runtime podman \
    --tag quay.io/sifa/devsecops-workshop:devel

podman push quay.io/sifa/devsecops-workshop:devel
```
